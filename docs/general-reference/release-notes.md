* [New features](#new-features)
* [Enhancements, changes, and resolved issues](#enhancements-changes-and-resolved-issues)

### New features

* **Visual explain**  
  Use the new visual explain feature to analyze query execution plans. Different display formats and navigation options enhance your ability to quickly analyze and diagnose complex queries. For more information, see [Analyze query execution plans with visual explain](../using-the-sql-workspace/using-explain-to-analyze-query-execution.md).

* **COPY TO statement (Beta)**  
  Use the new `COPY TO (Beta)` statement to export query results to an Amazon S3 location in CSV, TSV, JSON, or Parquet file formats. Configuration options allow you to choose file output options. For more information, see [COPY TO (Beta)](../sql-reference/commands/copy-to.md).

* **Firebolt CLI now available**  
  Run SQL and manage databases and engines in Firebolt directly from the command line. Use interactive mode or invoke commands from scripts. For more information, see [firebolt-cli](https://pypi.org/project/firebolt-cli/) on PyPI.

* **Python SDK now supports parameterized queries and multiple statements**  
  * **Parameterized queries** &ndash; Allows parameters to be inserted dynamically into SQL. Handles sanitization to help prevent SQL injection attacks. For more information, see [.execute\(\)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/#id15) in the Python Database API Specification and [firebolt.db.cursor module](https://python-sdk.docs.firebolt.io/en/latest/firebolt.db.html#module-firebolt.db.cursor) in the Firebolt Python SDK reference.
  * **Multiple statements** &ndash; Parses and separates multi-statement SQL, and then runs statements sequentially. For more information, see [.executemany\(\)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/#executemany) and [.nextset\(\)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/#nextset) in the Python Database API Specification, and [firebolt.db.cursor module](https://python-sdk.docs.firebolt.io/en/latest/firebolt.db.html#module-firebolt.db.cursor) in the Firebolt Python SDK reference.

* **Node.js SDK now available**  
  Provides a database driver for Node.js applications to connect to Firebolt and run queries more easily. For more information, see [Firebolt Node.js SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebolt-sdk) on npm.

* **Information schema for views**  
  For more information, see [Information schema for views](/information-schema/views.md).

* **Information schema for engines**  
  For more information, see [Information schema for engines](/information-schema/engines.md).

* **Added `ATAN2(<y_expr>,<x_expr>)`**  
  Added the two-argument arc tangent function [ATAN2](../sql-reference/functions-reference/atan2.md).

### Enhancements, changes, and resolved issues

* **Breaking change**  
  * Floating point data type columns are no longer supported in partition key definitions.

* **Enhanced Parquet support**  
  Firebolt now supports Parquet list fields with a period (`.`) in the name. In addition, Parquet nested lists are now supported.

* **catalog.query_history limited to 14 days**  
  Queries older than 14 days are no longer available when querying [catalog.query_history](/information-schema/query-history-view.md).

* **Firebolt dbt adapter**  
  * **Improved connection method** &ndash; The Firebolt dbt adapter now connects to Firebolt using the Python SDK instead of JDBC. JDBC and the JRE are no longer required.
  * **Upgraded to dbt 1.0.0** &ndash; The Firebolt dbt adapter has been upgraded to v1.0.0. For more information about new features available in 1.0.0, see [New features and changed documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/guides/migration-guide/upgrading-to-1-0-0#new-features-and-changed-documentation) in dbt documentation.

* **Resolved issues**  
  * Fixed an issue that caused inaccurate elapsed time for queries to be shown in the SQL workspace.
  * Fixed an issue during INSERT INTO operations that caused some engines to crash when reaching out of memory instead of failing gracefully.
  * Fixed an issue that caused the cached data ratio to be inaccurate for queries with a high `LIMIT` value.
  * Fixed an issue that could cause a `DROP AGGREGATING INDEX` statement to hang.
  * Fixed an issue that caused an engine crash when an unsupported function was used in a partition key definition.
  * Fixed an issue that allowed an aggregating index to be created with a window function, which is unsupported and caused unpredictable issues. Creating an aggregating index with a window function now fails with an error.
